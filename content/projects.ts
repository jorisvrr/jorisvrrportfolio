/**
 * PROJECTS — the one source for the Work index, the Featured Work spotlight
 * and the case studies.
 *
 * TWO RULES HOLD THIS FILE TOGETHER:
 *
 * 1. Everything beyond the identity of a project is OPTIONAL. A project that
 *    has no year, no stack, no architecture and no result simply has those
 *    fields absent, and every surface omits what is absent — it never
 *    substitutes a guess, a dash or a lorem line. Different projects can
 *    therefore have completely different case studies.
 *
 * 2. Nothing here may be invented. Titles, types and roles below were given
 *    by Joris; jorisvrr.com's stack and year are read off this repository.
 *    Everything still unknown (Goodreads' and BEBO's stack, dates, URLs,
 *    decisions, code, results) is simply missing, and stays missing until the
 *    real material exists. Placeholder MEDIA is allowed, but must be flagged
 *    `isPlaceholder`, which the interface labels as such.

          title: "The profiler was measuring the wrong thing",
          problem: "A tracer written to prove the sculpture's motion stayed continuous reported a regression of more than double after an optimisation that could not have caused one.",
          approach: "Trust the number, and start reverting.",
          wrong: "The tracer selected 176 path nodes when the core has 128, so it was following link geometry as well, and it measured distance per frame, which meant a dropped frame read as a jump.",
          solution: "Select exactly the core paths, and measure velocity per millisecond instead of per frame.",
          learned: "The regression was an artifact, and so was the improvement it had reported earlier. A measurement that cannot be wrong in both directions has not been checked.",

          title: "Optimising the wrong half of the screen",
          problem: "The Work formation dropped a fifth of its frames on a phone, and the sculpture handing its cubes to the surface was the obvious suspect.",
          approach: "Two rounds of work on the sculpture: quantised coordinates and shading, then fewer faces per cube and half the ring dissolved early.",
          wrong: "Together they cut path writes by 40% and moved style recalculation by nothing at all.",
          solution: "An isolation test, the same sequence with the sculpture removed, then with the surface's tiles removed, put 526ms of the 607ms on the tiles. The grid, not the geometry, was the cost.",
